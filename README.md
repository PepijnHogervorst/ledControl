# ledControl

Website to control WS2812 LEDs over wifi. To send and receive messages MQTT is used together with a ESP8266 (Wemos D1) module. 

## Getting started

To use the website correctly the user needs to have knowlegde of MQTT to setup a custom broker. 
Also right now the ESP8266 code is missing (will get added in the future)
